# Simple GraphQL CMS

This is a demo project that has been created for a 3 part blog series on using graphql with [Hasura](hasura-home)
and [Apollo](apollo-home)

It includes an Auth0 Apollo GraphQL server to communicate with the Auth0 Management API, a Hasura GraphQL Engine server
to store the blog posts, and a VueJS PWA for the client side representation and handling of the data, in other words a
really basic GUI for the CMS to create, update and view blog posts
